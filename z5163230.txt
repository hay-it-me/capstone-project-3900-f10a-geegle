Week 1
Group formed with my team. As a team, we decided on creating an event management system 
and worked on developing a list of functional requirements for our system. We also
began discussing what kind of software stack we would use.

Week 2
From the functional requirements that were created, Tony and I created all the Jira user
stories for each of the functional requirements. 

Week 3
We decided to use the PERN stack for our application. I had to spend
time learning express and node for the backend of our system. We also reviewed all
the user stories and wrote acceptance criteria for each of them.

Week 4 - Sprint 1
We reviewed all the acceptance criteria so that all the user stories could be added to
Jira. Furthermore, I worked on the system architechture section of the proposal and
created our logo. I also began creating the codebase and testing the dependencies.

Week 5 - Sprint 1
I pair programmed with Tony to start on the system design. We created the authorisation
and event creation modules based on industry-best practices, implementing JWT and bcrypt.

Week 6 - Sprint 2
We updated the database with new requirements for next sprint. I also continued to complete
tickets for creating and getting events and aligning them with front-end needs.

Week 7 - Sprint 2
I completed tickets for creating, editing and deleting review for events. In addition,
I updated Jira user flows to allow for a backend-to-frontend flow.

Week 8 - Sprint 2
I completed tickets for adding likes to reviews and reply to reviews. In addition, I made
modifications to the system to suit front-ends needs in preparation for the demonstration.

Week 9 - Sprint 3
I completed the algorithm to recommend events for users using a string matching algorithm,
as part of my Jira ticket.

Week 10 - Sprint 3
I assisted with the dashboard functionality, running unit testing/debugging the backend
and helping write the system architecture and implementation challenges on the backend.
